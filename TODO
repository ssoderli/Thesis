* OMP traces
* CUDA traces
...

Using MPI_Call now

-----------------------

How to choose how to cut the traces?
    - Spectral?
    - Based on percentage?
    - Based on time?
    - Both?
	- look at size of trace, then adjust percentage based on that?
Overlap cuts?
	- 0:5, 3:8, 6:11, ...
-------------------------

"Not nice" traces?
     - Traces that are not nicely divided into loops?

Flushing?

Dimemas, simulate ideal.
	 - learn to simulate this autimatically?
